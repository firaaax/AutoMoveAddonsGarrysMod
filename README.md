**AutoMoveAddonsGarrysMod**

*AutoMoveAddonsGarrysMod* is a Batch script designed to simplify the process of moving Garry's Mod-related files and folders between the current working directory and the Garry's Mod installation directory. The script provides two main options:

1. **Remove Gmod files:**
   - Moves CSS files, AdvDupe2, the Workshop folder, the Lua folder, and game-specific Workshop content to the current working directory.
   - Displays success or error messages for each move.

2. **Restore files to Gmod:**
   - Creates necessary folders in the Garry's Mod installation directory if they do not already exist.
   - Moves CSS files, AdvDupe2, the Workshop folder, the Lua folder, and game-specific Workshop content to their appropriate locations.
   - Displays success or error messages for each move.
  
3. **Bypass Bans:**
   - Bypass globanBan by removing specific addons **(features soon available)**

The script includes an interactive menu function allowing the user to choose between the two options. Additionally, it incorporates validation to ensure the user enters only valid values (1 or 2). Upon completion, the script provides a summary indicating the number of folders moved successfully and the number of errors, if any.
